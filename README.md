TMXCleaner
==========

Creates source text from TMX/TTX (Translation Memory files). Useful for "exporting/importing" between otherwise incompatible CAT software.

To make the magic happen, run with:

java -jar TmxCleaner [path to tm file]; e.g.: java -jar TmxCleaner.jar c:\random_file.tmx


So far, it seems to work with XML TM files by
MemoQ
SDL TagEditor
SDL Trados Studio 2011

If you have any problems with it, please, let me know. It still needs heavy testing with different versions of said programs.
